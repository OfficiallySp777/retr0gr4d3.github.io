# This is the online portal to my projects. Welcome.

I intend to make a theme for this site, to make it more interesting and interactive. Recently, I was using Semantic UI which is pre-generated CSS files. These files resulted in a mass of... Ugly nothingness and thus utter clutter in my repo. If anyone is willing to help me make this page wonderful, and worth visiting... Please, don't hesitate to help me.


## Ports and Edits

<details>
 <summary>The Chrom(ium/e) Easter Egg, T-Rex Run.</summary>
 Unfamiliar with this game? Far too privileged to have Wi-Fi drop-outs? There's a gif below. Enjoy.

 Feel free to play the game [here](http://retr0gr4d3.github.io/WhatThatTrexDo/). No Wi-Fi drama, with the freedom to do whatever you      like while playing.

 The tool linked below is a save editor for Fallout Shelter.
 The Fallout Shelter Tool will allow you to change everything within your save. Themes (like Halloween), Characters (like Names,     SPECIAL, HP and Radiation) and many more. You can have the game of your dreams, or prebuild your map before changing it to Survival with the newly implimented Game Mode Editor.
