# This is the online portal to my projects. Welcome.

I intend to make a theme for this site, to make it more interesting and interactive. Recently, I was using Semantic UI which is pre-generated CSS files. These files resulted in a mass of... Ugly nothingness and thus utter clutter in my repo. If anyone is willing to help me make this page wonderful, and worth visiting... Please, don't hesitate to help me.

Feel free to play the game [here](http://retr0gr4d3.github.io/WhatThatTrexDo/). No Wi-Fi drama, with the freedom to do whatever you like while playing.


## Game Modifiers

**Online Fallout Shelter Save Mod**

The tool linked below is a save editor for Fallout Shelter. It supports;

**Windows 10 Edition**

**Bethesda Launcher Version**

**Steam Version**

**Android Version**

And not tried or tested, nor am I intrested in doing so but feel free to try: **iOS Version**

The Fallout Shelter Tool will allow you to change everything within your save. Themes (like **Halloween**), Characters (like **Names**, **SPECIAL**, **HP** and **radiation**) and many more. You can have the game of your dreams, or prebuild your map before changing it to **Survival** with the newly implimented **Game Mode Editor**.
The tool can be found [here](https://retr0gr4d3.github.io/FalloutShelterMod/).
